        <div class="final-note">I really did not mind making this subpage, it's something I wanted to work webdev related for a while so it helps my skills as a programmer as well lol. It wasn't that much work. This domain was already my personal portfolio and I plan on adding blogs and other stuff eventually. </div>

        <div class="greeting">Hey Khloe!</div>
        
        <div class="note">[Uh, sorry for the small handwriting, I just realized at the end that your eyesight is not the best. Genuinely text me if you need translation]</div>

        <div class="paragraph">I hope you liked my design of the envelope. Evidently I am not artistically inclined, and also while you're reading this, you'll have to deal with my poor handwriting. [cry emoji] (If it means anything, I'm quite proud [of my drawing], although I hope Isabelle is recognizable) also this has to be in pencil bc god knows how many errors I'd make on a pen</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Maybe for a 2 month situationship, this letter and everything is a bit too much, but I don't care. I feel like I want to express my gratitude for what we had regardless.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">I would never had known I'd get into a relationship during my study abroad. I would never have known I'd meet you at a KPOP taster session. I would never have known we would next see each other at a pregame for ministry.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Obviously the circumstances were against us with me leaving in a semester and LITERALLY being gone more than half the weekends, and you being super busy with 3rd year and FilSoc.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">But somehow, we managed to be so much to each other in such a short timespan. Bang bang, drinking in LS, Notting Hill + Westview, Filipino food near kensington, Hyde Park, game day, Winter Wonderland, and other memories. I'd say it was a success to do so many fun things togther.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Of course with our limited time, we couldn't grow to be too attached or dependent on each other. Still, I enjoyed every minute with you, and missed every second you weren't there. We had such amazing chemistry, and everything went so well. I actually CANNOT believe I met a girl who even knows Aerith, let alone stans her.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Our interests were so similar when it came to JRPGs and games. All that said and done, the main point was that "this" set up such a good and high standard for what was my first "relationship." I am so glad a lot of my firsts were with someone so kind and caring.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">I know it'll be weird reading this at any time since you will be or will have moved on, so I want you to just treat this as a nice momento for all the happy times we had from a guy who passed by your life.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">I am always glad to be your friend for life, and I know you will be as well. I know you will always be there for me if I ever need it, and I'll be there for you.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">You might not know, but the past few months I've hidden a lot of anxiety and stress that I've struggled to open up to people including you. If we had more time, I would have opened up to you as well. I say this here because I'd like to think that being with you is a huge reason why I was able to suppress those feelings because of how happy I was with you. Thank you for that. Thank you for being my London tour guide. Thank you for the buns from home. Thank you for inviting me to hangouts with yoru friends. Thank you for being excited for my baseball team. Thank you for encouraging my completion of last minute assignments while on vacation. <span class="highlight">Thank you for being a wonderful part of my life!</span></div>

        <div class="paragraph">Life has other plans I guess, but I hope our paths can cross eventually again.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Might be 5000 miles apart, but I'm always a phone call away!</div>
