# This is the personal website for meâ€”Alan Guo

Here you will find a summary of my skills and experiences related to computer science and software engineering, as well as important links like LinkedIn and Github.

# About this website

I plan to keep this website updated with not only portfolio work but other interests in my life like my hobbies and random blogs. The main website url will be my portfolio, while eventually subdomains may contain things like blogs and other cool stuff.
